Friend Finder App

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, the result is displayed as a modal pop-up.
   * The modal will display both the name and picture of the closest match.
